                <h3>New York</h3>
                <p>paragraph about newyork.</p>
                <h3 class="heading">Statue of Liberty</h3>
                <p>Though the line for the ferry from Battery Park is long, if you get there early, you can avoid most of it.
                   The Statue of Liberty is spectacular to see up close, but the real highlight of this combo is Ellis Island, where you can learn about the immigrant experience and get a sense of the people who helped build NYC (you’ll even find my family’s name inscribed on the wall!). There’s such a great sense of history there that you can’t help but to be impressed.</p>
                <h3 class="heading">Wall street</h3>
                <p>Take a photo with the famous bull and then walk to Wall Street and see where all those bankers destroyed the economy. 
                   There's heavy security in the area, but you can sit and watch people whiz in and out of buildings on their way to cause some other financial disaster.</p>
                <h3 class="heading">World Trade Centre</h3>   
                <p>The recently opened “Freedom Tower” gives you a panoramic view of the city, and there is also a lot of information about the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On the elevator up, you can also see images of the historical development of NYC. At the bottom of the tower is a park commemorating the victims of the attacks along with an extensive museum. The museum houses moving exhibits about the significance of 9/11. For an additional fee, there are guided tours.</p>
